TODO:
1)Change the padding of the ratings so theyll be in the same column.

Raphi's questions:
Rename app - maybe TechnionRater?  Our app currently does not rank teachers - it rates them.
Add faculty fields to professors and courses?
How should comments work?
Maybe add loading page?
Maybe add privacy policy page?
