TODO:
1. Add "Your Account" to the overflow.
2. Add a back button.
3. # of ratings - a global variable.


Raphi's questions:
Rename app - maybe TechnionRater?  Our app currently does not rank teachers - it rates them.
Maybe add loading page?
New question: forget about liking comments? It's a little challenging and might not be worth the trouble.

Leo - Raphi discussed:

Welcome page consists of welcoming message and menu bar.
Menu bar consists of your courses, your head professors.
Every professor in the UG system you can search for.
You can rate anyone - but limit 10 ratings per semester.

Big tasks:
1. Menu bar
2. Database
3. Previous ratings
