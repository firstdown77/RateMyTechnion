TODO:

Small fixes:
Fix log in button.
Set up CourseView/ProfessorView existing ratings.


Maybe add loading page?

Every professor in the UG system you can search for.
You can rate anyone - but limit 10 ratings per semester.

Include screenshots of parsed pages in our poster?

Big tasks:

2. Menu bar
3. Previous ratings
